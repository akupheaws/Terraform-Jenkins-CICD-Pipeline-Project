# Project Overview

This repository demonstrates how to design and run a **fully automated CI/CD pipeline** using **Terraform** for infrastructure provisioning and **Jenkins** for orchestration. It enables seamless deployment of infrastructure and applications by treating everything—network setup, server bootstrapping, application deployment—as code. This project showcases your DevOps chops in real-world tasks like provisioning cloud infrastructure, configuring environments, and automating application delivery with a robust, production-style workflow.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Provision Jenkins and related infrastructure using Terraform.
- **Automated CI/CD:** Jenkins pipelines manage infrastructure provisioning, application build, and deployment.
- **Infrastructure Bootstrapping:** Use of Terraform or scripts to set up Jenkins on EC2 or similar hosts.
- **Secure Credential Handling:** Leverages Jenkins credentials and can accommodate Terraform plugins for security.
- **End-to-End Automation:** Example flows include Terraform init/plan/apply and Jenkins-managed application delivery.

 [Jenkins Server Provisioned and Ready]
         │
         ▼
    [Jenkins Pipeline Runs]
         │→ terraform init & plan
         │→ terraform apply (provision or update infra)
         │→ build/test application
         │→ deploy app to provisioned infra
         │→ optional smoke test

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Terraform** installed (v1.5+ recommended)
- **AWS account** (or other cloud provider configured)
- **Jenkins** (auto-provisioned or pre-configured)
- **Jenkins plugins**: Terraform, Git, AWS credentials management

### Steps

1. **Clone the repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/akupheaws/Terraform-Jenkins-CICD-Pipeline-Project.git
   cd Terraform-Jenkins-CICD-Pipeline-Project
   ```

2. **Provision infrastructure** (optional if Terraform handled via Jenkins):
   ```bash
   cd terraform
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply -auto-approve
   ```

3. **Set up Jenkins pipeline**:
   - Create a Jenkins Pipeline job pointing to the repo.
   - Provide credentials (AWS, Git, Docker registry).
   - Run the pipeline and watch provisioning, build, and deployment stages run through.

## ⚙️ Jenkinsfile (Pipeline as Code)

This declarative pipeline could include stages like:

```groovy
pipeline {
  agent any
  stages {
    stage('Terraform Init & Plan') {
      steps { sh 'terraform init && terraform plan' }
    }
    stage('Apply Infrastructure') {
      when { branch 'main' }
      steps { sh 'terraform apply -auto-approve' }
    }
    stage('Build & Test App') {
      steps { sh 'npm install && npm test' }
    }
    stage('Deploy App') {
      steps { sh './scripts/deploy.sh' }
    }
  }
}
```

## 🔒 Best Practices & Tips

- **Credential storage:** Use Jenkins credentials (AWS, Git tokens), not plaintext.
- **Least privilege:** Apply principle of least privilege to Jenkins and Terraform roles.
- **Modular Terraform:** Use proper state backend (e.g., S3 + DynamoDB for AWS).
- **Notifications:** Integrate email or Slack notifications on pipeline stages.
- **Test in branches:** Run Terraform plan on PRs and apply on merged branches only.

## 🛣️ Roadmap Ideas

- [ ] Add Blue/Green or canary deployment strategy.
- [ ] Integrate static code analysis or policy-as-code (e.g., Sentinel).
- [ ] Use shared libraries for Jenkins pipelines (Groovy).
- [ ] Add post-deployment validations (smoke or performance tests).
